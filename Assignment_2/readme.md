# Assignment 2 - Development of Large Scale Systems

The purpose of this assignment is to understand how to utilize GitHub Projects within a workflow. 
To grasp the usage of GitHub Projects, we implement two user stories related to the Chemical Warehouse. 
We employe GitHub issues to represent our user stories, and within these issues, we outline tasks that need to be completed before we can consider the user story as finished.

We convert the tasks issues, and to distinguish between them, we assign identification labels to the issues. 
The labels we have utilized are "User Story" and "TASK."

All current existing issues are allocated to our GitHub project, named DLS Assignment 2.

Our GitHub projects are organized into columns that reflect the status of issues:
- Backlog provides an overview of the product backlog and the total number of issues.
- Current Sprint represent the sprint backlog with all issues from the product backlog scheduled for completion in the current sprint.
- In Progress are for issues that are actively being worked on.
- Ready for Review indicates that an issue is completed by the assignee and awaits approval from another team member.
- Approved means the issue has been reviewed positively and is ready to be merged into the master/main branch by the assignee.
- Done,signify that the issue has been successfully implemented.
- Achieved gives an overview of all the issues completed during the sprint.

When the GitHub projects has been sat up, each team member gets assigned to a task, which is associated to a user story. 

In the issue, we assign a feature branch, from which we will do our work.

When the issue is ready to be merged into the master branch, we create a pull request associated to the branch and issue.

After the reviewer apporves the pull request, the assignee of the pull request merges the feature branch into master branch.
Afterward, the issue in GitHub projects will be in the column 'Done'.

When a task issue has been moved to done, it will automatically update the assoicated user story issue.

# Final product so far
We have developed a very simple client that communicates with a server. 
The endpoints we have established are as follows:

Here is the link to our GitHub projects:

# Reflections
For future GitHub projects, we will consider adding time estimates to better plan the duration for issues. 
We might also refine the specificity of the labels we use. 
In this project, we distinguished issues using 'User Story' and 'TASK', but we could further detail tasks, such as specifying if a task involves creating a new model or method.
